This is a very tightly coupled version of Abstract factory. 
===

Classes involved
---
* Abstract factory: Class
* Concrete factories: Warrior, Mage
* Abstract products: Clothes, Weapon
* Concrete products: (Armor, Cape), (Sword, Staff)

Results
* Unsatisfactory
* Still, it's working.
* There are too many methods. To decouple a little: use constructors properly
